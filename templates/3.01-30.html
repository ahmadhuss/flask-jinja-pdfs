        7.—
        (1) Without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any existing
        shares
        or
        class
        of shares but subject to the Act, shares in the company may be issued by the directors.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Shares referred to in paragraph (1) may be issued with preferred, deferred, or other special
        rights
        or
        restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital, or otherwise, as the
        directors,
        subject
        to any ordinary resolution of the company, determine.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        8.—
        (1) If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights
        attached to
        any
        class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, whether or
        not
        the
        company is being wound up, be varied with —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; the consent in writing of the holders of 75% of the issued shares of that class; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders
        of
        the
        shares
        of the class.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) The provisions of this Constitution relating to general meetings apply with the necessary
        modifications
        to
        every separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class referred to in paragraph
        (1),
        except
        that—<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; the necessary quorum is at least 2 persons holding or representing by proxy one-third of
        the
        issued
        shares of the class; and<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;

        9. The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other
        rights
        are,
        unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, treated as
        being
        varied
        by the creation or issue of further shares which ranks equally with the shares of that class.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        10. The company may on any issue of shares pay any brokerage that is permitted by law.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        11.—
        (1) Except as required by law, no person is to be recognised by the company as holding any share
        upon
        any
        trust.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Except as required by law or by this Constitution, the company is not bound by or compelled in
        any
        way

        recognise —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or unit of a share;
        or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; any other rights in respect of any share or unit of share, other than the registered

        absolute
        right to the entirety of the share or unit of share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) Paragraph (2) applies even when the company has notice of any interest or right referred to in

        (2) In respect of a share or shares held jointly by several persons, the company is not bound to
        issue
        more
        than
        one certificate, and delivery of a certificate for a share to one of several joint holders is
        sufficient
        delivery to all such holders.

        13.—
        (1) The company has a first and paramount lien on —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; every share (that is not a fully paid share) for all money (whether presently payable or
        not)
        called
        or payable at a fixed time in respect of that share; and<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; all shares (other than fully paid shares) registered in the name of a single person for
        all
        money
        presently payable by the person or the person’s estate to the company.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) The company’s lien, if any, on a share extends to all dividends payable on the share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) The directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or partly exempt from paragraph (1)
        or
        (2),
        or
        both.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        14.—
        (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the company may sell, in any manner as the directors think fit, any
        shares
        on
        which the company has a lien.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) No sale may be made under paragraph (1) unless —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of the amount in respect of which the
        lien
        exists
        as is presently payable, has been given by the company to the registered holder for the time being
        of
        the
        share,
        or the person entitled to the share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the registered holder of
        the
        share;
        and<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (c)&emsp; a period of 14 days has expired after the giving of the notice in sub-paragraph (b).<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        15.—
        (1) To give effect to any sale of shares under regulation 14, the directors may authorise any person

        transfer
        the shares sold to the purchaser of the shares.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Subject to regulations 25, 26 and 27, the company must lodge a notice of transfer of shares in
        relation
        to
        the shares sold to the purchaser with the Registrar.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) The purchaser of any shares referred to in paragraph (1) is not bound to see to the application
        of
        the
        purchase money, and the purchaser’s title to the shares is not affected by any irregularity or
        invalidity in
        the
        proceedings with respect to the sale of the shares.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        16.—
        (1) The proceeds of any sale of shares under regulation 14 received by the company must be applied

        any part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Any remaining proceeds from the sale of shares must (subject to any lien for sums not presently
        payable
        as
        existed upon the shares before the sale but which have become presently payable) be paid to the
        person
        entitled
        to the shares at the date of the sale.

    <div style="line-height:1.7; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&emsp;
        17.—
        (1) The directors may from time to time make calls upon the members in respect of any money unpaid
        on
        their
        shares, other than in accordance with the conditions of the allotment of the shares, if both of the
        following
        conditions are met:<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; no call is payable at less than one month after the date fixed for the payment of the last
        preceding
        call;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and the place of payment is given by
        the
        company
        to the members.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Each member must pay to the company at the time or times and place specified in the notice
        referred
        to
        in
        paragraph (1)(b) the amount called on the member’s shares.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) The directors may revoke or postpone a call.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        18.—
        (1) A call is treated as having been made at the time when the resolution of the directors
        authorising
        the
        call
        was passed.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) A call may be required to be paid by instalments.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        19. The joint holders of a share are jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect of the
        share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        20.—
        (1) If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment of
        the
        sum,
        the
        person from whom the sum is due must pay interest on the sum for the period beginning on the day
        appointed
        for
        payment of the sum to the time of actual payment of the sum at such rate not exceeding 8% per annum
        as
        the
        directors may determine.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) The directors may waive, wholly or in part, the payment of the interest referred to in paragraph
        (1).<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        21.—
        (1) Any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed
        date
        is to
        be
        treated as a call duly made and payable on the date on which, by the terms of issue of the share,
        the
        sum
        becomes payable.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) In the case of non-payment of any sum referred to in paragraph (1), all the provisions of this
        Constitution
        as to payment of interest and expenses and forfeiture apply as if the sum had become payable by
        virtue
        of a
        call
        duly made and notified.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        22. The directors may, on the issue of shares, differentiate between the holders as to the amount of
        calls
        to be
        paid and the times of payment.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        23.—
        (1) The directors may, if they think fit, receive in advance from any member (if the member is
        willing)
        all
        or
        any part of the money uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by the member.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Upon the company receiving the money referred to in paragraph (1), the directors may (until the
        amount
        would, but for the advance, become payable) pay interest to the member at such rate not exceeding
        (unless
        the
        company in general meeting otherwise directs) 8% per annum as may be agreed upon between the
        directors
        and

        writing in any usual or common form or in any other form which the directors may approve.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) The instrument of transfer must be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and the transferor
        remains
        the
        holder of the shares transferred until the name of the transferee is entered in the electronic
        register
        of
        members.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        25.—
        (1) To enable the company to lodge a notice of transfer of shares with the Registrar under section
        128(1)(a)
        of
        the Act, the following items in relation to the transfer of shares must be delivered by the
        transferor
        to
        the
        registered office of the company:<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; the instrument of transfer;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; a fee not exceeding $1 as the directors from time to time may require;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (c)&emsp; the certificate of the shares to which the instrument of transfer relates;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (d)&emsp; any other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the
        transferor
        to
        make
        the transfer.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Upon receipt of the items referred to in paragraph (1), the company must, subject to regulation
        26,
        lodge
        with the Registrar a notice of transfer of shares in accordance with section 128 of the Act and
        retain
        the
        instrument of transfer referred to in regulation 24.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        26. The directors may decline to lodge a notice of transfer of shares with the Registrar if —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; the shares are not fully paid shares;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; the directors do not approve of the transferee; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (c)&emsp; the company has a lien on the shares.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        27. The lodging of any notice of transfer of shares with the Registrar for the purpose of updating
        the
        electronic register of members may be suspended at any time and for any period as the directors may
        from
        time to
        time determine, but not for more than a total of 30 days in any year.

        28.—
        (1) Where a sole holder of shares of the company dies, the company may recognise only the legal
        personal
        representatives of the deceased as having any title to the deceased’s interest in the shares.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Where a joint holder of shares of the company dies, the company may recognise only the survivor
        or
        survivors
        of the deceased as having any title to the deceased’s interest in the shares.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) Nothing in paragraph (2) releases the estate of the deceased from any liability in respect of
        any
        share
        which had been jointly held by the deceased with other persons.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        29.—
        (1) Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member
        may,
        upon
        such
        evidence being produced as may from time to time properly be required by the directors, elect to
        —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; be registered as holder of the share in the electronic register of members; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; nominate another person to be registered as the transferee of the share in the electronic
        register
        of
        members.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Despite paragraph (1), the directors have the same right to decline or suspend the lodging of a
        notice
        of
        transfer of shares with the Registrar for the purpose of updating the electronic register of members
        under
        regulations 26 and 27 as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by the member
        referred
        to in
        paragraph (1) before the death or bankruptcy of the member.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        30.—
        (1) If a person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member
        elects to
        be
        registered as holder of the share in the electronic register of members, the person must deliver or
        send
        to
        the
        company a notice in writing signed by the person stating that the person elects to be registered in
        the
        electronic register of members as the holder of the share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) If a person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member
        elects to
        nominate another person to be registered as the transferee of the share in the electronic register
        of
        members,
        the person must execute a transfer to that other person a transfer of the share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) All the limitations, restrictions, and provisions of this Constitution relating to the right to
        transfer
        and
        the lodging of a notice of transfer by the company in relation to any transfer of shares are
        applicable
        to
        any
        notice referred to in paragraph (1) or transfer referred to in paragraph (2), as if the death or
        bankruptcy
        of
        the member concerned had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by the
        member.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        31.—
        (1) Where the registered holder of any share dies or becomes bankrupt, the personal representative
        of
        the
        registered holder or the assignee of the registered holder’s estate, as the case may be, is, upon
        the
        production
        of such evidence as may from time to time be properly required by the directors, entitled to the
        same
        dividends
        and other advantages, and to the same rights (whether in relation to meetings of the company, or to
        voting,
        or
        otherwise), that the registered holder would have been entitled to if the registered holder had not
        died
        or
        become bankrupt.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Where 2 or more persons are jointly entitled to any share in consequence of the death of the
        registered
        holder, they are, for the purposes of this Constitution, treated as joint holders of the share.

    <div style="line-height:1.7; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&emsp;
        32. If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment of
        the
        call
        or
        instalment of the call, the directors may, as long as any part of the call or instalment remains
        unpaid,
        serve a
        notice on the member requiring payment of the unpaid part of the call or instalment, together with
        any
        interest
        which may have accrued.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        33. The notice under regulation 32 must —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; name a day (not earlier than 14 days after the date of service of the notice) on or before
        which
        the
        payment required by the notice is to be made; and<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; state that, in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed, the shares in
        respect
        of
        which the call was made is liable to be forfeited.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        34.—
        (1) If the requirements of a notice referred to in regulation 33 are not complied with, any share in
        respect
        of
        which the notice was given may, at any time after the notice is given but before the payment
        required by
        the
        notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the directors passed for the purpose of
        forfeiting
        the
        share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Forfeiture under paragraph (1) includes all dividends declared in respect of the forfeited
        shares
        and
        not
        paid before the forfeiture.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        35. A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on any terms and in any manner as the
        directors
        think
        fit, and, at any time before a sale or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on any terms as
        the
        directors think fit.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        36.—
        (1) A person whose shares have been forfeited ceases to be a member in respect of the forfeited
        shares.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Despite paragraph (1), the person referred to in that paragraph remains liable to pay to the
        company
        all
        money which, at the date of forfeiture, was payable by the person to the company in respect of the
        shares
        (together with interest at the rate of 8% per annum beginning on the date of forfeiture on the money
        for
        the
        time being unpaid if the directors think fit to enforce payment of such interest).<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        37. A statutory declaration in writing that the declarant is a director or the secretary of the
        company,
        and
        that a share in the company has been forfeited on a date stated in the declaration, is conclusive
        evidence
        of
        the facts stated in the declaration as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        38.—
        (1) The company may receive the consideration, if any, given for a forfeited share on any sale or
        disposition of
        the forfeited share and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the
        share is
        sold or
        disposed of (called in this regulation the transferee).<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Upon the company executing a transfer of the share in favour of the transferee, the company must
        lodge a
        notice of transfer of share with the Registrar under section 128 of the Act for the purpose of
        updating
        the
        electronic register of members to reflect the transferee as the registered owner of the forfeited
        share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) The transferee is not bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, and the
        transferee’s
        title to the share is not affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings with respect
        to
        the
        forfeiture, sale, or disposal of the share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        39. The provisions of this Constitution as to forfeiture apply in the case of non-payment of any sum
        which,
        by
        the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time as if the sum had been payable by
        virtue
        of a
        call duly made and notified.

        40. The company may by ordinary resolution passed at a general meeting convert any paid-up shares
        into
        stock
        and
        reconvert any stock into paid-up shares.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        41.—
        (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the holders of stock may transfer the stock or any part of the stock
        in
        the
        same
        manner, and subject to the same regulations, by which the shares from which the stock arose might,
        prior
        to
        conversion, have been transferred.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) The directors may from time to time fix the minimum amount of stock transferable and restrict or
        forbid
        the
        transfer of fractions of that minimum.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        42.—
        (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the holders of stock have, according to the amount of the stock held
        by
        the
        holders, the same rights, privileges and advantages in relation to dividends, voting at meetings of
        the
        company
        and other matters as if they held the shares from which the stock arose.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) No privilege or advantage (except participation in the dividends and profits of the company and
        in
        the
        assets on winding up) is to be conferred by any aliquot part of stock on the holder of such stock
        which
        would
        not, if existing in shares, have conferred that privilege or advantage on the holder of such
        stock.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        43. Provisions of this Constitution applicable to paid-up shares apply to stock, and references to
        “share”
        and
        “shareholder” in this Constitution are to be read as if they were references to “stock” and
        “stockholder”,
        respectively.

        (a)&emsp; consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; subdivide its shares or any of them such that in the subdivision the proportion between
        the
        amount
        paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced share is the same as it was in the case of the
        share
        from
        which the reduced share is derived;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (c)&emsp; cancel the number of shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution have not
        been
        taken
        or
        agreed to be taken by any person or which have been forfeited, and diminish the amount of its share
        capital
        by
        the number of the shares so cancelled.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        45.—
        (1) Subject to any direction to the contrary that may be given by the company in general meeting,
        all
        new
        shares
        must, before issue, be offered to all persons who, as at the date of the offer, are entitled to
        receive
        notices
        from the company of general meetings, in proportion, or as nearly as the circumstances admit, to the
        amount
        of
        the existing shares to which they are entitled.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) The offer must be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered, and limiting a time
        within
        which
        the offer, if not accepted, is treated to be declined.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) After the expiration of the time referred to in paragraph (2), or upon the person to whom the
        offer
        is
        made
        declining the shares offered, the directors may dispose of those shares in any manner as they think
        is
        the
        most
        beneficial to the company.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (4) The directors may dispose of any new shares which (by reason of the ratio which the new shares
        bear
        to
        shares held by persons entitled to an offer of new shares) cannot, in the opinion of the directors,
        be
        conveniently offered under this regulation.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        46. The company may, by special resolution and with any consent required by law, reduce its share
        capital in
        any
        manner.

        or
        a
        limited liability partnership which is a member.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;

        the

        (b)&emsp; by at least 3 members present in person or by proxy;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (c)&emsp; by any member or members present in person or by proxy and representing not less than 5%
        of
        the
        total
        voting rights of all the members having the right to vote at the meeting; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (d)&emsp; by a member or members holding shares in the company conferring a right to vote at the
        meeting
        being
        shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than 5% of the total sum paid up
        on
        all
        the
        shares conferring that right.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Unless a poll is demanded, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has on a show of
        hands
        been
        carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect in
        the
        book
        containing the minutes of the proceedings of the company is conclusive evidence of the fact without
        proof of
        the
        number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against the resolution.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) The demand for a poll may be withdrawn.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        56.—
        (1) Subject to paragraph (2), if a poll is demanded it must be taken in such manner and either at
        once
        or
        after
        an interval or adjournment or otherwise as the chairman directs. <br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment must be taken
        immediately.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) The result of the poll is a resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        57. In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of
        the
        meeting at
        which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded is entitled to a second or
        casting
        vote.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        58.—
        (1) Subject to any rights or restrictions for the time being attached to any class or classes of
        shares,
        at
        meetings of members or classes of members, each member entitled to vote may vote in person or by
        proxy
        or by
        attorney.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) On a show of hands every member or representative of a member who is present in person has one
        vote.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) On a poll every member present in person or by proxy or by attorney or other duly authorised
        representative
        has one vote for each share the member holds.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        59.—
        (1) In the case of joint holders, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by
        proxy,
        is
        accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), seniority is to be determined by the order in which the names
        stand
        in
        the electronic register of members.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        60. A member who is mentally disordered or whose person or estate is liable to be dealt with in any
        way
        under
        the law relating to mental capacity may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by a person
        who
        properly
        has the management of the estate of the member, and any such person may vote by proxy or attorney.
        61. No member is entitled to vote at any general meeting unless all calls or other sums presently
        payable by
        the
        member in respect of shares in the company have been paid.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        62.—
        (1) No objection may be raised as to the qualification of any voter except at the meeting or
        adjourned
        meeting
        at which the vote objected to is given or tendered.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Any objection made in due time must be referred to the chairman of the meeting, whose decision
        is
        final
        and
        conclusive.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) Every vote not disallowed at the meeting is valid for all purposes.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        63.—
        (1) The instrument appointing a proxy must be in writing, in the common or usual form and —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; where the appointer is a corporation or a limited liability partnership, under the hand of
        an
        officer
        or attorney duly authorised; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; in any other case, under the hand of the appointer or of the attorney of the appointer
        duly
        authorised
        in writing.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) A proxy may but need not be a member of the company.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) The instrument appointing a proxy is treated as conferring authority to demand or join in
        demanding
        a
        poll.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        64. Where an opportunity of voting for or against a resolution is to be conferred on members, the
        instrument
        appointing a proxy may be in the following form or such other form as the board of directors may
        approve:<br>&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;
        “I/We*, [name(s)], of [address(es)], being a member/members* of the abovenamed company, appoint
        [name]
        of
        [address], or failing him/her, [name] of [address], as my/our* proxy to vote for me/us* on my/our*
        behalf at
        the
        [annual or extraordinary, as the case may be] general meeting of the company, to be held on [date],
        and
        at
        any
        adjournment of the meeting.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;
        Signed on [date].<br>&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;
        This form is to be used in favour of/against* the resolution.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;
        *Delete whichever is not applicable. [Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy may vote as he or she
        thinks
        fit.]”.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        65.—
        (1) The following documents must be deposited at the registered office of the company, or at such
        other
        place in
        Singapore as is specified in the notice convening the meeting by the time specified in paragraph (2)
        for
        the
        purpose of appointing a proxy:<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; the instrument appointing a proxy;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; the power of attorney or other authority, if any, under which the instrument appointing
        the
        proxy
        is
        signed,<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        or a notarially certified copy of that power of attorney or authority.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the time is —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; in the case of a poll, not less than 24 hours before the time appointed for the taking of
        the
        poll; or
        <br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; in any other case, not less than 72 hours before the time for holding the meeting or
        adjourned
        meeting
        at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) An instrument of proxy is not valid if paragraph (1) is not complied with.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        66.—
        (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy or
        attorney is
        valid despite —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; the previous death or mental disorder of the principal;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; the revocation of the instrument or of the authority under which the instrument was
        executed;
        or
        <br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (c)&emsp; the transfer of the share in respect of which the instrument is given.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply if an intimation in writing of such death, mental disorder,
        revocation,
        or
        transfer has been received by the company at its registered office before the commencement of the
        meeting or

        67.—
        (1) At the first annual general meeting of the company, all the directors must retire from
        office.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) At every annual general meeting subsequent to the first annual general meeting of the company,
        one-third
        of
        the directors for the time being, or, if their number is not 3 or a multiple of 3, then the number
        nearest
        one-third, must retire from office.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        68. A retiring director is eligible for re-election.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        69. The directors to retire in every year must be those who have been longest in office since their
        last
        election, but, as between persons who became directors on the same day, those to retire must (unless
        they
        otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot. <br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        70.—
        (1) The company at the meeting at which a director retires may fill the vacated office by electing a
        person
        to
        fill the vacated office.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) If the company does not fill the vacated office, the retiring director is, if he or she offers
        himself
        or
        herself for re-election and is not disqualified under the Act from holding office as a director,
        treated
        as
        re-elected, unless —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; at that meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill the vacated office; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; a resolution for the re-election of that director is put to that meeting and lost.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        71. The company may from time to time by ordinary resolution passed at a general meeting increase or
        reduce
        the
        number of directors, and may also determine in what rotation the increased or reduced number is to
        go
        out of
        office.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        72.—
        (1) The directors have power at any time, and from time to time, to appoint any person to be a
        director,
        either
        to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing directors, but the total number of
        directors
        must
        not
        at any time exceed the number fixed in accordance with this Constitution.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Any director appointed under paragraph (1) holds office only until the next annual general
        meeting,
        and
        is
        then eligible for re-election.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) Any director appointed under paragraph (1) must not be taken into account in determining the
        directors
        who
        are to retire by rotation at the next annual general meeting.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        73.—
        (1) The company may by ordinary resolution remove any director before the expiration of his or her
        period of
        office, and may by an ordinary resolution appoint another person in place of the removed director.
        <br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) The person appointed in place of the removed director is subject to retirement at the same time
        as
        if
        the
        person had become a director on the day on which the director in whose place the person is appointed
        was
        last
        elected a director.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        74.—
        (1) The remuneration of the directors is, from time to time, to be determined by the company in
        general
        meeting.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) The remuneration of the directors is treated as accruing from day to day.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) The directors may also be paid all travelling, hotel, and other expenses properly incurred by
        them
        in
        attending and returning from meetings of the directors or any committee of the directors or general
        meetings
        of
        the company or in connection with the business of the company.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        75. The shareholding qualification for directors may be fixed by the company in general meeting.
        <br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        76. The office of director becomes vacant if the director — <br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; ceases to be a director by virtue of the Act;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his or her creditors
        generally;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (c)&emsp; becomes prohibited from being a director by reason of any order made under the Act;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (d)&emsp; becomes disqualified from being a director by virtue of his or her disqualification or
        removal
        or
        the
        revocation of his or her appointment as a director, as the case may be, under — <br>

        78. Without limiting the generality of regulation 77, the directors may exercise all the powers of

        to do all or any of the following for any debt, liability, or obligation of the company or of any

        meetings
        as they think fit.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) A director may at any time summon a meeting of the directors.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) The secretary must, on the requisition of a director, summon a meeting of the directors.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;

        (1) Subject to this Constitution, questions arising at any meeting of directors must be decided by a
        majority of
        votes and a determination by a majority of directors is for all purposes treated as a determination
        of
        the
        directors.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) In case of an equality of votes the chairman of the meeting has a second or casting vote.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;

        transaction.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) If a director referred to in paragraph (1) does vote in respect of any transaction or proposed
        transaction
        referred to in that paragraph, the director’s vote must not be counted.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        86. The quorum necessary for the transaction of the business of the directors may be fixed by the
        directors,

        87.—
        (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the directors may act despite any vacancy in their body.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) If and so long as the number of directors is reduced below the number fixed by this Constitution
        as
        the
        necessary quorum of directors, the continuing directors or director may not act except for the
        purpose
        of
        increasing the number of directors to that number or for the purpose of summoning a general meeting
        of
        the
        company.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        88.—
        (1) The directors may elect a chairman of their meetings and determine the period for which the
        chairman
        is
        to
        hold office.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) If no chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within 10 minutes
        after
        the
        time
        appointed for holding the meeting, the directors present may choose one of their number to be
        chairman

        89.—
        (1) The directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of any member or members
        of
        their
        body as the directors think fit.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Any committee formed under paragraph (1) must in the exercise of the delegated powers conform to
        any
        regulation that may be imposed on it by the directors.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        90.—
        (1) A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings. <br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) If no chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within 10 minutes
        after
        the
        time
        appointed for holding the meeting, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman
        of
        the
        meeting.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        91.—
        (1) A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Questions arising at any meeting must be determined by a majority of votes of the members
        present,
        and
        in
        the case of an equality of votes the chairman has a second or casting vote.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        92. All acts done by any meeting of the directors or of a committee of directors or by any person
        acting
        as
        a
        director is as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a
        director,
        even if
        it is afterwards discovered that —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; there was some defect in the appointment of any director or person acting as a director;
        or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; the directors or person acting as a director or any of them were disqualified.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        93.—
        (1) A resolution in writing, signed by all the directors for the time being entitled to receive
        notice
        of a
        meeting of the directors, is as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the
        directors
        duly
        convened and held.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Any resolution in writing under paragraph (1) may consist of several documents in like form,
        each
        signed
        by
        one or more directors.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        94. Where the company has only one director, the director may pass a resolution by recording it and
        signing
        the
        record.

        director
        for
        such period and on such terms as they think fit and, subject to the terms of any agreement entered

        the
        amount
        recommended by the directors.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        103. The directors may from time to time pay to the members such interim dividends as appear to the
        directors to
        be justified by the profits of the company.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        104. No dividend is to —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; be paid otherwise than out of profits; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; bear interest against the company.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        105.—
        (1) The directors may, before recommending any dividend —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; set aside out of the profits of the company sums as they think proper as reserves; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; carry forward any profits which they may think prudent not to divide, without placing the
        profits
        to
        reserve.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) The reserves set aside under paragraph (1)(a) —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; are, at the discretion of the directors, to be applied for any purpose to which the
        profits of

        be

        as
        the directors may from time to time think fit.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;

        (1) Subject to the rights of persons, if any, entitled to shares with special rights as to dividend,
        all
        dividends must be declared and paid by reference to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the
        shares
        in
        respect of which the dividend is paid.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), no amount paid or credited as paid on a share in advance of
        calls
        is
        to
        be treated for the purposes of this regulation as paid on the share.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) All dividends must be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid or credited as
        paid
        on
        the
        shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (4) If any share is issued on terms providing that it ranks for dividend as from a particular date,
        that
        share
        ranks for dividend accordingly.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        107. The directors may deduct from any dividend payable to any member all sums of money, if any,
        presently
        payable by the member to the company on account of calls or otherwise in relation to the shares of
        the
        company.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;

        (1) Any general meeting declaring a dividend or bonus may by resolution direct payment of the
        dividend
        or
        bonus
        wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets, including —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; paid-up shares of any other company;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; debentures or debenture stock of any other company; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (c)&emsp; any combination of any specific assets, <br> and the directors must give effect to the
        resolution.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Where any difficulty arises with regard to a distribution directed under paragraph (1), the
        directors
        may do
        all or any of the following:<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; settle the distribution as they think expedient;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; fix the value for distribution of the specific assets or any part of the specific
        assets;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (c)&emsp; determine that cash payments be made to any members on the basis of the value fixed by the
        directors,
        in order to adjust the rights of all parties;<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (d)&emsp; vest any specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the directors.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        109.—
        (1) Any dividend, interest, or other money payable in cash in respect of shares may be paid by
        cheque or
        warrant
        sent through the post directed —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; in the case of joint holders —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
        (i)&emsp; to the registered address of the joint holder who is first named on the electronic
        register of
        members; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
        (ii)&emsp; to a person or to an address as the joint holders may in writing direct; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (b)&emsp; in any other case —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
        (i)&emsp; to the registered address of the holder; or<br>&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
        (ii)&emsp; to a person or to an address as the holder may in writing direct.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (2) Every cheque or warrant made under paragraph (1) must be made payable to the order of the person
        to
        whom
        it
        is sent.<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (3) Any one of 2 or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividends, bonuses, or
        other
        money
        payable in respect of the shares held by them as joint holders.

        (2) The directors have full power to —<br>&nbsp;&emsp;
        (a)&emsp; make provision by the issue of fractional certificates or by payment in cash or otherwise
        as
